# Product Incident Report Template

Use this template to capture details about an incident, and share back potential solutions and prevention tasks.
We capture the details of our incidents to ensure we find the root cause and take actions to prevent it from happening in the future.

## Summary

## Impact

*Include impact to all potential different groups.*

*% or # of users impacted; in what way; for how long Number of staff needed to resolve the issues; how long Any $ impacts*

- End-users: 

- CDS Staff: 

- Other government department(s):

## Detailed Timeline 

*Be as specific as possible. When did we first learn about the incident? How did we learn about it? What did we do when we learned about it?*

*Include details on what we tried and why we tried it with the information we knew at the time.*

## Trigger:

*Who/what called the incident and how was it called? (incident called by automated system, etc…)?*

## Detection:

*How did we determine that an incident needed to be called? (Automated system alert, client submitted report, on-call page, slack notification, etc)**

## Resolution:

*What immediate and long-term fixes were put in place to resolve the issue?*

## Root Cause(s):

*What was determined to be the technical/process root cause(s) of the incident? Ask yourself why 5 times to ensure this is the root cause(s).*

*If you’re adamant the error lies with the user ( ‘human factors’), what controls or interface affordances were missing allowing for this?*

## Lessons Learned

*What did we learn from this incident?  How did it go well, what could have gone better and where did luck play a role?  Going through this exercise can help identify action items.*

### What went well

### What went wrong

## Action Items:

*What should we do now to prevent a future incident like this one?  What can we do to reduce the impact of any of the future incidents?*

*Think about: How were we made aware of the issue? Were the right people notified? Could we have known sooner? Did we have information at our fingertips to resolve the problem? Did we have humans doing work computers would do better? Did we get lucky, could it have been worse?*

*Types [Investigate, Mitigate (now), Repair, Detect, Mitigate (future), Prevent]*

*Priority*

*- P0: High risk of unmitigated recurrence of the incident if this is not resolved.*

*- P1: Medium risk of unmitigated recurrence of the incident if this is not resolved.*

*- P2: Low risk of unmitigated recurrence of the incident if this is not resolved.*

*- P3: Trivial risk of unmitigated recurrence of the incident if this is not resolved.*
